# Quick start

This is a minimalist introduction showing how to control the gripper using the C++ driver.

Refer to API documentation to get more details.

## Import dependencies

<!-- snippet: quick_start.cpp qs-includes -->
```cpp
// Import gripper C++ driver
#include <Robotiq/gripper.hpp> // Gripper, GripperCommand/Status, activate(), recoverFromFault()

// Import utilities libraries
#include <iostream> // Library use to write message in the terminal.
#include <chrono> // duration literals for the waitFor() timeouts below (1s, 200ms, ...)
using namespace std::chrono_literals; // enables the 1s / 200ms / 5s literals below
```

## Write the main program

Everything from here on goes inside `int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { ... }` in quick_start.cpp.

### Create a connection configuration
Create a ConnectionConfig object and specify which port the gripper is connected to.
The port is read from the program's first command-line argument.

To find which port your gripper is actually connected to:
- **Windows**: open Device Manager → **Ports (COM & LPT)**. The gripper
  shows up as an FTDI USB Serial Port; note its `COMx` number.
- **Linux**: run `ls /dev/ttyUSB*` — the gripper is typically `/dev/ttyUSB0`
  (or the newest device that appears after plugging it in).
- **macOS**: run `ls /dev/tty.usbserial-*`.

<!-- snippet: quick_start.cpp qs-config -->
```cpp
if(argc < 2)
{
   std::cerr << "Usage: quick_start <port>\n";
   return 1;
}
Robotiq::ConnectionConfig config;
config.serial.port = argv[1]; // e.g. "COM4" on Windows, "/dev/ttyUSB0" on Linux, "/dev/tty.usbserial-XXXX" on macOS
```

Run the built binary with your port, e.g. `./quick_start /dev/ttyUSB0`
(Linux/macOS) or `quick_start.exe COM4` (Windows).

### Create a gripper object
Create a gripper object using the previously created connection configuration.

<!-- snippet: quick_start.cpp qs-create-gripper -->
```cpp
Robotiq::Gripper gripper(config);
```

### Activate the gripper
Gripper activation is the first action to perform before being able to use the
gripper. The C++ driver provides a function to perform gripper activation.

<!-- snippet: quick_start.cpp qs-activate -->
```cpp
Robotiq::activate(gripper);
```

> **Note :**
> If the gripper is already activated, the activate function does nothing. To force the activation process the gripper activate (rACT) bit has to be set to false or the gripper power has to be removed.
>
> This is different from `recoverFromFault()`, which also reactivates the gripper immediately (running the calibration sweep) as part of the same call — use the approach above instead if you want the gripper to stay deactivated until you call `activate()` yourself.

### Create a command

To control the gripper you have to write a command with appropriate parameter and send it.

The command is initially built from a default command.
The GoTo bit of the action register has to be set to 1 so that the gripper moves to the position written in its position register.

<!-- snippet: quick_start.cpp qs-create-command -->
```cpp
Robotiq::GripperCommand command = Robotiq::GripperCommand::defaults();
command.action.set(Robotiq::ActionRequestBit::GoTo);
command.positionRequest = 100;
command.speed = 255;
command.force = 255;
```

### Send the command
Once the command is prepared we can send it to the gripper using the setCommand function.

<!-- snippet: quick_start.cpp qs-send-command -->
```cpp
gripper.setCommand(command);
```

### Wait for the action to be completed
The C++ driver comes with a convenient wait function that can be used to wait for a gripper action to complete before moving to the next step of the program.

First we wait for the gripper to acknowledge the reception of the command.

Then, if the requested position is different from where the gripper already
was, we wait for it to actually start moving before waiting for it to
settle. This step is skipped when the gripper was already at the requested
position, since it will never report `Moving` in that case — there's
nothing to wait for.

Finally, we wait for the command to complete.

<!-- snippet: quick_start.cpp qs-wait -->
```cpp
// 6- Wait for the gripper to echo
Robotiq::waitFor([&] { return gripper.getStatus().positionRequestEcho == command.positionRequest; }, 1s);

// 7- Wait for the gripper to start moving
Robotiq::waitFor(
   [&] { return (gripper.getStatus().gripperStatus.objectDetection() == Robotiq::ObjectDetection::Moving); },
   200ms);

// 8- Wait for the gripper to stop
Robotiq::waitFor(
   [&] { return (gripper.getStatus().gripperStatus.objectDetection() != Robotiq::ObjectDetection::Moving); },
   5s);
```

### Retrieve gripper status

The status of the gripper can be retrieved with the getStatus function. Here is an example where we retrieve and print the current position of the gripper.

<!-- snippet: quick_start.cpp qs-status -->
```cpp
// 9- retrieve status
uint8_t currentPosition = gripper.getStatus().position;

// Print retrieved status
std::cout << "Current position : " << static_cast<int>(currentPosition) << std::endl;
```
