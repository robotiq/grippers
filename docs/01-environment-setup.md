# Environment setup
This page covers setting up a project that *uses* the Robotiq gripper C++
SDK as a dependency: installing prerequisites, bringing the SDK into your
own build.

CMake ≥ 3.16, a C++17 compiler, libserialport.

## Bring the SDK into your project
Add the **grippers** complete repository (or just `sdk_cpp/`) as a git submodule inside your own project.

Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/main-project
```

Add the sdk as a submodule of your project using git:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/robotiq/grippers third_party/grippers
```

This creates a folder named "grippers" inside the "third_party" folder of your project.

Check out the latest release so you build against a stable, tagged
version rather than the tip of `main`:

```bash
git -C third_party/grippers checkout v1.0.0
```

Track `main` instead only if you need an unreleased fix or feature —
in that case pin to an exact commit rather than floating on the branch.

Then wire it into your own `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
add_subdirectory(third_party/grippers/sdk_cpp)
target_link_libraries(your_app PRIVATE Robotiq::grippers)
```

The SDK's own `CMakeLists.txt` also exposes a few build-configuration
options (`GRIPPERS_HOSTED`, `GRIPPERS_BUILD_DEFAULT_SERIAL`, …); the
defaults are right for a normal desktop build, so you only need to look
at [CMake options](#cmake-options) below if you're consuming the SDK
differently — e.g. on a target with no hosted C++ runtime.

## Compilation environment

The environment to compile the C++ code of the driver differs depending on your operating system.

| Platform | Build environment |
|----------|----------------|
| Ubuntu/Debian | native terminal |
| macOS | native terminal |
| Windows | MSYS2 — see [Windows](#windows) below |

### Linux and macOS

The installation of the libserialport library on Linux or macOS is straightforward.

Install libserialport:
```sh
sudo apt install libserialport-dev   # Ubuntu/Debian
brew install libserialport           # macOS
```

### Windows

Because the C++ driver uses the libserialport library, compiling it on
Windows is a bit specific. libserialport supports Windows natively, but
it uses a Linux-style build system (autotools) that's awkward to set up
directly on Windows. The trick is to use MSYS2, which provides a
Linux-like terminal and a prebuilt Windows-native toolchain (GCC,
CMake, Ninja) so you can build against it directly, without touching
autotools yourself.

MSYS2 is a Windows distribution of Unix tooling with pacman (the Arch Linux package manager) and a large repository of prebuilt native libraries.

1. Install MSYS2 from [msys2.org](https://www.msys2.org)
   (or `winget install MSYS2.MSYS2`).
2. Open the **MSYS2 UCRT64** shell from the Start menu.
3. Install the toolchain and dependencies:

   ```sh
   pacman -Syu
   pacman -S --needed mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc \
             mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-cmake \
             mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-ninja \
             mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-libserialport \
             mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gdb
   ```
4. You will be prompted to close the shell to complete the install. Close it.

## Compile from the terminal

Once the SDK is wired into your `CMakeLists.txt`, configuring and building is
the same CMake invocation on every platform, from your project's root:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j
```

**Windows**: run these commands from the **MSYS2 UCRT64** shell (Start
menu) — that's what puts `cmake`, `ninja`, and `gcc` on `PATH` (see
[Windows](#windows) above for installing that toolchain). Pass an
explicit generator, since `cmake` outside a Visual Studio environment
doesn't reliably pick Ninja on its own:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

Then run the built binary directly, passing whatever arguments your
own application expects (e.g. the serial port):

```sh
./build/your_app /dev/ttyUSB0        # Linux/macOS
./build/your_app.exe COM3            # Windows
```

## Instructions to set up VS Code

1. Install the **C/C++** and **CMake Tools** extensions (both
   publisher `ms-vscode`).
2. **Windows only** — as mentioned above, you need the MSYS2 GCC
   toolchain, since libserialport ships no MSVC package. Register a
   compilation kit once via Command Palette → **CMake: Edit User-Local
   CMake Kits**, so it's offered in every workspace on your machine:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "MSYS2 UCRT64 GCC",
     "compilers": {
       "C": "C:/msys64/ucrt64/bin/gcc.exe",
       "CXX": "C:/msys64/ucrt64/bin/g++.exe"
     },
     "preferredGenerator": { "name": "Ninja" },
     "cmakeSettings": {
       "SERIALPORT_LIBRARY": "C:/msys64/ucrt64/lib/libserialport.a",
       "CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS": "-static -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++",
       "CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_LIBRARIES": "-lsetupapi -lcfgmgr32"
     }
   }
   ```

   Together these settings produce a fully static executable:
   `SERIALPORT_LIBRARY` points at libserialport's static archive instead
   of its `.dll`, and `-static -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++`
   statically links the C/C++ runtime too — without that second part
   you'd still need MSYS2's own `libstdc++`/`libgcc` DLLs at runtime
   even with libserialport itself linked statically. That's what lets
   what you build run on any Windows machine with no MSYS2 or its DLLs
   installed.
3. Command Palette → **CMake: Select a Kit**.
   On Windows, pick the **MSYS2 UCRT64 GCC** kit registered above.
   On Linux/macOS, pick whichever kit CMake Tools finds for your system compiler.
4. **CMake: Configure**, then **CMake: Build** (or the matching buttons
   in the status bar at the bottom of the window).
5. To run your own target, once it's built: select it as the active
   target in the status bar's target picker (this also happens
   automatically the first time you build it), then click **Run** (▷)
   in the status bar, or open a terminal and run the built `.exe`
   directly. Either way, if your program takes arguments (e.g. a
   serial port like `COM3`), set them once in `cmake.debugConfig.args`
   in your own `.vscode/settings.json` (`.vscode/` is gitignored except
   for `extensions.json`, so this file is yours alone — create it if it
   doesn't exist yet) and the status bar's Run/Debug buttons will pass
   them automatically.

You can develop and test without a physical gripper at all: call
[`makeFakeGripper()`](../sdk_cpp/include/Robotiq/gripper/fake/gripper_factory.hpp)
instead of constructing a `Gripper` from a `ConnectionConfig` — same API
from there on, so swapping in a real gripper later is a one-line change.

## Updating the SDK later

Update the submodule pointer to the new commit or tag, then rebuild —
no separate reinstall step:

```sh
cd third_party/grippers
git fetch
git checkout <new-tag-or-commit>
cd ../..
git add third_party/grippers
```

## Serial port notes

- **Linux**: add yourself to the `dialout` group for `/dev/ttyUSB*` access:

  ```sh
  sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER
  ```
  Log out and back in (or reboot) for the new group membership to take
  effect — it's read when your login session starts, so a new terminal
  alone isn't enough. Without it, opening the port fails with a
  permission error even though the device shows up in `/dev`.
  The SDK sets the FTDI `latency_timer` to 1 ms automatically when it has
  permission (the kernel default of 16 ms triples Modbus latency); for
  unprivileged use, ship a udev rule that sets it at plug time.
- **Windows**: the FTDI latency timer is a driver setting (Device Manager →
  COM port → Port Settings → Advanced → Latency Timer); set it to 1 ms for
  high-rate control.
- **macOS**: the FTDI latency timer defaults to 16 ms — capping the exchange
  rate near ~60 Hz — and macOS offers no way to lower it from the SDK. To run
  faster, install [FTDI's VCP driver](https://ftdichip.com/drivers/vcp-drivers/)
  and set its `LatencyTimer` to `1` (in the driver's `Info.plist`); it then
  applies to every open, including this SDK's. On macOS 11+ also approve the
  driver in System Settings → Privacy & Security and make sure it — not
  Apple's built-in FTDI driver — binds your adapter (`kextstat | grep -i ftdi`).
  Otherwise ~60 Hz is the ceiling on the default driver.
  **Unproven:** this procedure hasn't been verified on real hardware; if you
  try it, please report back with what worked (or didn't).
- Factory-default link settings: 115200 baud, 8N1, Modbus slave 0x09.
- Port naming: `/dev/ttyUSB0` on Linux, `COM3` on Windows,
  `/dev/tty.usbserial-XXXX` on macOS.
- **Windows**: thread pacing is quantized by the OS timer (default tick
  ~15.6 ms), so exchange periods shorter than ~16 ms will run slower
  than configured. High-rate control on Windows is currently untuned —
  open an issue if your application needs it.

## CMake options

[`sdk_cpp/CMakeLists.txt`](../sdk_cpp/CMakeLists.txt) exposes five
`option()`s. The defaults are right for a normal desktop build — you
adjust them when you're consuming the SDK differently: as a dependency
that shouldn't build its own examples/tests, or on a target that
doesn't have a hosted C++ runtime (see
[Embedded / bare-metal builds](05-embedded-builds.md) for that case
in detail).

| Option | Default | What it controls |
|---|---|---|
| `GRIPPERS_BUILD_EXAMPLES` | `ON` when top-level, `OFF` via `add_subdirectory()` | Builds `examples/quick_start` and `examples/move_gripper`. |
| `GRIPPERS_BUILD_TESTS` | `ON` when top-level, `OFF` via `add_subdirectory()` | Builds and registers the unit tests with CTest. |
| `GRIPPERS_HOSTED` | `ON` | Whether the target has a hosted C++ runtime (`std::thread`, `iostream`). `ON` compiles the `std::thread`-backed `Platform` (`makeDefaultPlatform()`) and the stderr default logger, and links `Threads::Threads`. |
| `GRIPPERS_BUILD_FAKE` | follows `GRIPPERS_HOSTED` | Builds [`makeFakeGripper()`](03-how-it-works.md#without-a-gripper) and the fake device it drives. ~30 KB; only useful to hosted consumers, since the fake device needs the threaded exchange loop to run. |
| `GRIPPERS_BUILD_DEFAULT_SERIAL` | follows `GRIPPERS_HOSTED` | Builds the libserialport-backed `DefaultSerial` and the `ConnectionConfig`-based constructors that use it. |

"Top-level" means configuring `sdk_cpp` directly
(`cmake -S sdk_cpp -B build ...`) rather than through
`add_subdirectory()` — that's the case when building the SDK repository
itself, not when consuming it, so it doesn't apply to the
[vendoring setup](#bring-the-sdk-into-your-project) above: when your
own project pulls the SDK in with
`add_subdirectory(path/to/grippers/sdk_cpp)`, both GRIPPERS_BUILD_EXAMPLES and
GRIPPERS_BUILD_TESTS default to OFF automatically, so your build doesn't also
compile this repo's example and test binaries; turn them back on explicitly if
you want them anyway (`-DGRIPPERS_BUILD_TESTS=ON`).

`GRIPPERS_BUILD_FAKE` and `GRIPPERS_BUILD_DEFAULT_SERIAL` both need
`GRIPPERS_HOSTED=ON` — configuring with one of them `ON` while
`GRIPPERS_HOSTED=OFF` is a `FATAL_ERROR`, not a silent downgrade, since
neither can actually be satisfied without the hosted runtime. Similarly,
turning `GRIPPERS_BUILD_DEFAULT_SERIAL` `OFF` on an otherwise hosted
build doesn't error, but examples and tests need it (they exercise the
real serial transport), so they're skipped with a `message(STATUS ...)`
rather than built:

```sh
cmake -S sdk_cpp -B build -DGRIPPERS_BUILD_DEFAULT_SERIAL=OFF
# -- grippers: examples need GRIPPERS_BUILD_DEFAULT_SERIAL; skipping them
# -- grippers: tests need GRIPPERS_BUILD_DEFAULT_SERIAL; skipping them
```

You'd flip GRIPPERS_BUILD_DEFAULT_SERIAL off, on an otherwise-hosted desktop
build, if you're injecting your own `Serial` (e.g. talking to the gripper through
something other than libserialport) and don't want the libserialport
dependency at all.
