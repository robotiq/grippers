//! \brief Build-configuration macros, defaulted for consumers compiling
//! against the headers without the CMake target (which defines both itself):
//!   GRIPPERS_HOSTED — 1 on a hosted runtime (std::thread, iostream, a wall
//!   clock); 0 on a freestanding target. Gates only the hosted conveniences:
//!   the wait helpers that sleep on the default Platform.
//!   GRIPPERS_BUILD_DEFAULT_SERIAL — 1 when the OS-backed DefaultSerial
//!   and the ConnectionConfig constructors that build it are compiled in.
//!   Targets without it inject their own Serial.

// The default transport is a desktop convenience: without a hosted runtime
// there is no OS serial API to drive, so the default follows GRIPPERS_HOSTED.
