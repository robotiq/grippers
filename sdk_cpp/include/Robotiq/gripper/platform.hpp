//! Every Gripper runs on one: hosted applications pass
//! makeDefaultPlatform(); an RTOS target implements this over the native
//! primitives — ports/threadx/threadx_platform.hpp is the working
//! reference. A single-threaded target (bare superloop) should skip
//! Gripper entirely and drive detail::GripperModbusClient itself — that
//! layer needs no Platform.
//!
//! **Concurrency contract for implementations:** the sleeps may be
//! called from several threads at once (the exchange thread paces with
//! sleepUntil() while a blocked procedure like activate() polls with
//! sleepFor()); makeMutex() and spawn() are called during gripper
//! construction only.
//!
//! RTOS-specific integration caveats (a yielding Serial::read, the
//! backing of steady_clock, task priorities) are documented in the
//! reference port, ports/threadx/threadx_platform.hpp — read them before
//! implementing this interface for an RTOS.
