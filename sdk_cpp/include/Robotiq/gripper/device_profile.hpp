//!        opening range and speed.
//!
//! openPosition and closedPosition are measured, not taken from the
//! manual: with nothing between the fingers, command rPR 0 and read gPO
//! back, then command rPR 255 and read gPO back. Do this on your own
//! gripper when filling a new profile, especially with custom fingers.
//!
//! \warning Position <-> register conversion are valid only while
//!          the gripper stays in parallel-finger mode. In encompassing
//!          mode gPO can go past closedPosition; this profile has no way
//!          to represent that, so a reading taken in encompassing mode
//!          does not convert to a meaningful opening.
//!
//! \warning minOpening, maxOpening, openPosition and closedPosition
//!          depend on which fingers are installed on the gripper:
//!          swapping fingers changes the physical opening range, and
//!          can shift the measured register endpoints too.
